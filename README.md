# Dev experiments

For now this repo only contains experiments using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) along with the [data-navigator](https://dig.cmu.edu/data-navigator/) library in order to make data visualizations more accessible.

These are only experiments. As such they do not always meet accessibility requirements from [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), [EN 301 549](https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu/content-corner/digital-library/en-3015492021-accessibility-requirements-ict-products-and-services_en) or [Chartability](https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF/).

## Run the examples locally

```

npm start
```
